        <h1>WELCOME TO MY PAGE!</h1>
        <p>Here is my first paragraph. What sort of content will you find
            on this site? Keep reading to find out!
        </p>
        <p>This site is a place to share some of my analog photography, mainly on 35mm film and with a very 
            <br>small amount of medium format (120) film. I started taking photos with a hand-me-down 35mm film 
            <br>camera from my dad in 2009. Since then I've had a lot of fun learning about different cameras and
            <br>film types, and even ventured into developing my own film in my bathtub!

        <p> ...and I'll even include a <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">
            <b><em>link</em></b></a> to somewhere else, I'm just not sure where yet.</p>
        <div class="navigation">
        <p>I will also eventually have links to subpages with thematic collections of photos like:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Self</li>
            <li>Food & Friends</li>
            <li>Home Sweet Home(s)</li>
            <li>It's a Sign!</li>
            <li>Toy Cameras</li>
        </ul>
